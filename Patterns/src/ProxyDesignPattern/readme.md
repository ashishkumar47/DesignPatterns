🧍 Real-Life Example: Security Guard (Proxy)
Imagine you want to enter a building (Real Object).
But there's a security guard at the entrance (Proxy).

If you're allowed in, the guard opens the door.

If not, the guard blocks you.

You never interact with the building directly — the guard mediates access.
