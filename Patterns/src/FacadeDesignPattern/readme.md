âœ… Intent:
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

ðŸ’¡ Real-world Analogy:
Think of a home theater system with:

DVD Player

Projector

Sound System

Lights

Instead of manually turning each on/off in the right order, you press one button on the remote â€” thatâ€™s your Facade.
