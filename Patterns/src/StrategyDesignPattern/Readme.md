ðŸŽ¯ Intent:
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Let the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

ðŸ¤” Real-Life Analogy:
Think of a navigation app (like Google Maps):

You can choose a route strategy: by car, by bike, or walking.

You can change the strategy without changing the app logic.
