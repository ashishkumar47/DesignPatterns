âœ… Intent:
Add new responsibilities (behavior) to objects dynamically at runtime, without changing their class.

ðŸ’¡ Real-world Analogy:
Think of a coffee shop:

A base coffee costs $2

You can decorate it with:

Milk (+$1)

Sugar (+$0.5)

Whipped Cream (+$1.5)

You donâ€™t modify the Coffee classâ€”you just wrap it with decorators.
